Subject: [PATCH 54/N] cygthread: suspend thread before terminating.

This addresses an extremely difficult to debug deadlock when running
under emulation on ARM64.

A relatively easy way to trigger this bug is to call `fork()`, then
within the child process immediately call another `fork()` and then
`exit()` the intermediate process.

It would seem that there is a "code emulation" lock on the wait thread
at this stage, and if the thread is terminated too early, that lock
still exists albeit without a thread, and nothing moves forward.

It seems that a `SuspendThread()` combined with a `GetThreadContext()`
(to force the thread to _actually_ be suspended, for more details see
https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20150205-00/?p=44743) makes
sure the thread is "booted" from emulation before it is suspended.

Hopefully this means it won't be holding any locks or otherwise leave
emulation in a bad state when the thread is terminated.

Also, attempt to use `CancelSynchonousIo()` (as seen in `flock.cc`) to
avoid the need for `TerminateThread()` altogether.  This doesn't always
work, however, so was not a complete fix for the deadlock issue.
