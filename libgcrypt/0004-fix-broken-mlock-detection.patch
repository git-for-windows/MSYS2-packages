Subject: [PATCH 4/4] Fix broken mlock detection

We need to be careful when casting a pointer to a `long int`: the
highest bit might be set, in which case the result is a negative number.

In this instance, it is fatal: we now take the modulus of that negative
number with regards to the page size, and subtract it from the page
size. So what should be a number that is smaller than the page size is
now larger than the page size.

As a consequence, we do not try to lock a 4096-byte block that is at the
page size boundary inside a `malloc()`ed block, but we try to do that
_outside_ the block.

Which means that we are not at all detecting whether `mlock()` is
broken.

Let's be very careful to case the pointer to an _unsigned_ value
instead.
