Subject: [PATCH 2/3] RunTest: adjust ISO-8859-1 tests for Cygwin
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

PCRE2 has a test that verifies the "starting code unit" for several
ISO-8859-1 tests. In particular, it wants to verify that the code points
0xAA, 0xB5 and 0xBA in ISO-8859-1 (which translate to ª, µ and º,
respectively) are considered to be word characters, 0xB5 even a
lower-case one.

However, Cygwin does _not_ consider those characters to be word
characters, but considers them _punctuation_ characters:
https://github.com/cygwin/cygwin/blob/cygwin-3.4.2/newlib/libc/ctype/ctype_iso.h#L10-L12
(punctuation characters are marked up with a `_P`, see
https://github.com/cygwin/cygwin/blob/cygwin-3.4.2/newlib/libc/include/ctype.h#L98,
and alphanumerical characters are marked up with `_U` for upper-case,
`_L` for lower-case and `_N` for numerical characters:
https://github.com/cygwin/cygwin/blob/cygwin-3.4.2/newlib/libc/include/ctype.h#L99).

Therefore, these tests will always fail.

Let's work around this by specifically testing whether the mu character
is considered a word character, and if not, edit the expectations
accordingly.
